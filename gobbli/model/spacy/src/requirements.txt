# We're using the PyTorch image with CUDA 10.1, but spaCy doesn't have an extra
# requirements specifier for CUDA 10.1 at the time of this writing (it only has 10.0).
# We could use the "cuda" extra requirements specifier, but it results in spaCy
# requiring the source distribution of cupy, which can't be compiled in a container
# without the NVIDIA runtime (which would require us to have separate images for GPU
# and no-GPU).  So, we manually install the spaCy GPU dependencies so we get
# wheels compatible with CUDA 10.1.
